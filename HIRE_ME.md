### I can 

* basic manage BSDs systems - install software, use ports, set up network interfaces, etc.
* the same goes for solaris based systems (illuminos), and GNU/linux.
* fearlessly look for solution on stack overflow
* write code in HTML, CSS, basic JS, basic PHP, basic C, now I'm focusing on C and JS/TS now.

### My projects

[Korny](https://github.com/DesantBucie/korny) is plugin simplifying use of ksh93, and I think it is my most useful project. It makes easier to make new prompts with good performance, it has git branch prompting built in and long and short pwd prompting. Also I think it has only `autocd` solution that was made by [MCDutchie](https://github.com/MCDutchie) after I asked him for a solution. It works on many systems (including OpenBSD where tput command needs three arguments instead of one)

[Paleofetch-BSD](https://github.com/DesantBucie/paleofetch-bsd) is a fork of a copy of neofetch written in C. Currently works only on mac, I'll try to bring it on the BSDs and Solaris family. It is on macOS even **20 times faster** than neofetch. Most of code is new.

[Easy-Vim](https://github.com/DesantBucie/easy-vim) is currently just a prototype and concept of what I would like achieve, that is, easy to set and use vim completion almost or completly without additional dependecies. If you want something already working then use my [Verde distribution](https://github.com/DesantBucie/Verde)(It works very well with macvim.) or [exrc](https://github.com/DesantBucie/exrc). 

[Aquila](https://github.com/DesantBucie/aquila) is old learning project, that is quite abandoned that I'm sure has many mistakes, and outdates, but it's example of me working with data from api.
